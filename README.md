Dhole Optimization Algorithm: a New Metaheuristic Algorithm for Solving Optimization Problems


This paper presents the Dhole Optimization Algorithm (DOA), an innovative method inspired from the social 
and hunting activities of dholes, especially their vocal communication and coordination techniques. DOA 
simulates distinctive behaviors, including vocalization-driven adaptive decision-making and dynamic pack 
formation, which improve the balance between exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. The 
efficacy of DOA is assessed using 23 classical benchmark functions, in addition to the CEC-2019 and CEC-2022 
benchmark sets, together with a range of real-world optimization problems. The findings indicate that DOA 
routinely attains competitive performance relative to established metaheuristic algorithms, frequently surpassing 
them in convergence time and robustness, especially for complex, high-dimensional problems. This work's 
primary contribution involves the development of a new nature-inspired optimization algorithm that incorporates 
adaptive methods inspired by dhole pack dynamics, accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation that underscores 
the strengths of DOA. The suggested DOA demonstrates a robust capacity to preserve variety, avoid local optima, 
and adjust to changing problem environments, rendering it a promising method for addressing complex 
optimization challenges and enhancing nature-inspired optimization methods.
